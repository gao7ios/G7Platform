/**
 * The G7WebImageManager is the class behind the UIImageView+WebCache category and likes.
 * It ties the asynchronous downloader (G7WebImageDownloader) with the image cache store (SDImageCache).
 * You can use this class directly to benefit from web image downloading with caching in another context than
 * a UIView.
 *
 * Here is a simple example of how to use G7WebImageManager:
 *
 *  G7WebImageManager *manager = [G7WebImageManager sharedManager];
 *  [manager downloadWithURL:imageURL
 *                  delegate:self
 *                   options:0
 *                  progress:nil
 *                 completed:^(UIImage *image, NSError *error, BOOL fromCache)
 *                 {
 *                     if (image)
 *                     {
 *                         // do something with image
 *                     }
 *                 }];

/**
 * The cache filter is a block used each time G7WebImageManager need to convert an URL into a cache key. This can
 * be used to remove dynamic part of an image URL.
 *
 * The following example sets a filter in the application delegate that will remove any query-string from the
 * URL before to use it as a cache key:
 *
 * 	[[G7WebImageManager sharedManager] setCacheKeyFilter:^(NSURL *url)

 * @param progressBlock A block called while image is downloading
 * @param completedBlock A block called when operation has been completed.
 *
 *                       This block as no return value and takes the requested UIImage as first parameter.
 *                       In case of error the image parameter is nil and the second parameter may contain an NSError.
 *
 *                       The third parameter is a Boolean indicating if the image was retrived from the local cache
